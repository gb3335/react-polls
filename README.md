| type         |             "multiple" or "binary"             |    ✔     |         binary          | Determines rendered poll type. Binary is recommended for yes-no questions where multiple is "one from many".                                                                                                                                                   |

Invisible if not set.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| results      | Array of objects with keys "text" and "votes". |    ✔     |                         | Results data is visible to the user after the vote. <br> Should be stored permanently! Usually red and wrote to the persistent storage source. <br> Array is modified every time user votes by incrementing the "votes" value and adding "percentage" element. |
| theme        |       Object <br>More in the table below       |    ✖     | More in the table below | Theme allows you to customize the look and feel of given poll. Depending on poll type there are different options.                                                                                                                                             |

Might be helpful when we want to keep showing results on every rerender after user has voted.                                                                 |

To be used in conjunction with isVoted. **\*Only enabled for multiple**.                                                                       |

Returns the clicked item's and whole results modified object as arguments.                                                                                                                               |
| showPrecents |                    Boolean                     |    ✖     |          false          | When set to true, poll will show the results in percentage else will show 'x votes'                                                                                                                                                                            |
